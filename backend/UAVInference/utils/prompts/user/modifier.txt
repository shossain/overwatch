Here is a text description generated of what is going on in a particular scene: {{response}}

Here is some more context generated by algorithms tracking the evolution of the scene's state:

Changes in the Scene: {{changes}}

Patterns observed in the Scene: {{Patterns}}

Qualitative Scene Changes: {{scene_changes_qualitative}}

Based on the above context, if you don't feel like the text description captures enough detail, then modify it so that it is more accurate, BUT KEEP IT BRIEF.
Otherwise, just return the original text description from the top.
DO NOT output anything else.
