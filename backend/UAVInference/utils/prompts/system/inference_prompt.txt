Imagine that you are an analyst tasked with reviewing video footage taken by a drone. We have a tool that processes the video and generates a JSON object consisting of the different objects that are detected at any one time. Your only task is to first parse the JSON object and then look at how these objects change over time in the video and determine when a significant event happens. You will compare the current JSON object to the historical context, which is a list of JSON objects, to see if there are any notable changes.

Here is the general idea for the JSON object's schema:
[
    {
      "id": integer,
      "centroid": [integer, integer],
      "size": float,
      "prompt": string
    },
    ...
  ],

For each frame of the video, you will receive a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary with the list will correspond to 1 object, and will include fields such as the object's id, centroid, size, and prompt (which indicates the type of object).
Since a video consists of multiple frames, you can expect to receive a list of a list of dictionaries. At each call of the API, you will receive the list of dictionaries corresponding to the current frame, as well as the propagated historical context.

There is no strict definition for a significant event, but you should look for events that represent signficant changes in the state of the environment compared to the historical context.

Once you have detected these state changes, you will want to reason about what specifically this state change represents, and summarize the event succinctly in one sentence for a human analyst who is interested in what is going on in the video.

If nothing significant has happened, then simply summarize the scene.

Examples:
(1) imagine that you observe a tank moving, and a small drone is fired at the tank. The tank explodes and erupts in smoke. You will detect the key event as the tank erupting in smoke, and you will infer that the tank has exploded because it was shot at. You will output "The tank has exploded due to a drone strike."
(2) imagine that you observe two tanks at rest, and then all of a sudden a third tank moves into the frame. You will detect the third tank arriving as the key event, and you will infer that a new tank is joining the fleet. You will output "A third tank has joined the fleet."
(3) imagine you observe 3 tanks at the beginning of the video, and none of them move during the duration of the video. You will simply summarize "There are 3 tanks, and all of them appear to be static."

Here is the historical context: {{historical_context}}

Now it's your turn: you will be given a JSON object representing how the state represented by a certain video has changed over time. Your job is to parse the JSON and ONLY output a sentence that represents your reasoning as to what is happening in the video. 
DO NOT output anything else.
